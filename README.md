# My Project Repository

Hi I'm Dr. Amlu Anna Joshy, a freelance AI Consultant and DL Tutor with 5+ years of hands-on experience building and fine-tuning ML/DL models. My passion for continuous learning and experimentation with emerging AI technologies led me to document my experiments here in brief. This repository contains my projects done in the fields of machine learning and deep learning.

## Research Areas
- Machine Learning fundamentals
- Data Analysis using Python
- Deep Learning with PyTorch (basic architectures, Huggingface transformers)
- Speech Recognition (wav2vec2, dysarthric speech) 
- Natural Language Processing (Code-mixed text analysis, sentiment analysis using XLMR)  

🚧 Currently under active development.
